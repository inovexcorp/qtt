# This configuration controls the timing for the datasource health check service

# Health checks are performed every 2 minutes by default to reduce connection churn.
# Previous default was 30 seconds (0/30 * * * * ?)

# Consecutive failure threshold: Number of consecutive health check failures before
# automatically stopping all routes for a datasource. Set to 0 or -1 to disable automatic
# route stopping. Default is -1, indicating not to shut off routes.
# Recommended: Set to 3 (6 minutes of downtime with 2-minute checks) to auto-disable
# routes for persistently failing datasources.
